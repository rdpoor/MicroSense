# MicroSensor User Notes

## Serial Output

The serial output is configured for 115200 baud, 8-bit, one stop bit, no parity.
It prints a CSV record once every 250 milliseconds.  The format is:

```
<auto>, <gain>, <count>, <vneg>, <vpos>

<auto>  is either 'M' or 'A' for Manual or Autoranging gain.
<gain>  system gain: 1 for minimum gain, 4 for 4x gain, 16 for maximum gain.
<count> Conductivity as a unit-less value.  To account for the gain,
        normalize the count by dividing by the system gain, e.g. <count>/<gain>.
<vneg>  used for diagnostics
<vpos>  used for diagnostics
```

## Analog Output

The analog output provide a quick way to visualize rapid changes to the
measured conductance.  It outputs a voltage between 0 and 3.3 volts.

## Gain Settings

If SDA and SCL are left open or connected to Vcc, the system works on autoscale.
Otherwise:

```
SDA  SCL  Gain
  0    0  01: col3 = V_OUT * 2047 * 15 * 1
  0    1  04: col3 = V_OUT * 2047 * 15 * 4
  1    0  16: col3 = V_OUT * 2047 * 15 * 16
  1    1  Autoranging: Gain automatically switches between 01, 04, 16
```

## On Units

The SoulPhone firmware emits a string on the serial line once every 250 mSec, or more precisely, once every 15 complete samples.  (Some samples may be dropped
if the 60Hz sync pulse is absent.)

The third column is an indication of the conductance between the electrodes.

Assuming 0 volts on Vinn (aka V_REF), a 1 volt output on Vinp (aka V_OUT)
results in an ADC count of 2047.  The resulting string on the serial output is:

   V_OUT (avg) = column_3 / (2047 * 15)

Note: a future version of the code will support variable gain, in which case the
gain factor must be taken into account.

## About ADC

The ADC is configured for:
* Differential input on PA0 (+) and PA2 (-)
* 12-bit signed output in the range -2048 ... 2047.
* Switchable gain.
* Internal voltage reference is the 1V bandgap

The ADC's differential inputs must not exceed the internal voltage reference of
1.0 v.  Vinn sits around 0.0v ("noise"), Vinp ramps from 0.0v to 1.0 v (signal +
noise), so this condition is satisfied.

Since the ADC is in differential mode:
* When configured for no gain stage, Vinn MUST be on PA0 PA1 PA2 or PA3
* When configured with gain, Vinn MUST be on PA4 PA5 PA6 or PA7

Note that Vinn connects to both PA2 and PA4, so we can switch between these two
modes:

To configure gain = 1:
```
ADCA.CH0.CTRL = ADC_CH_GAIN_1X_gc | ADC_CH_INPUTMODE_DIFF_gc;
ADCA.CH0.MUXCTRL = ADC_CH_MUXPOS_PIN0_gc | ADC_CH_MUXNEG_PIN2_gc;
```

To configure gain = 4
```
ADCA.CH0.CTRL = ADC_CH_GAIN_4X_gc | ADC_CH_INPUTMODE_DIFFWGAIN_gc;
ADCA.CH0.MUXCTRL = ADC_CH_MUXPOS_PIN0_gc | ADC_CH_MUXNEG_PIN4_gc;
```

To configure gain = 16
```
ADCA.CH0.CTRL = ADC_CH_GAIN_16X_gc | ADC_CH_INPUTMODE_DIFFWGAIN_gc;
ADCA.CH0.MUXCTRL = ADC_CH_MUXPOS_PIN0_gc | ADC_CH_MUXNEG_PIN4_gc;
```

## Reconfiguring for Unsigned mode

The client would like the ADC to run in unsigned mode.  This comes with a few
restrictions:

* ADC must be single-ended
* Programmable gain is not available
* Input voltage is limited to Vref/2 to Vref (i.e. 0.5 <= Vin <= 1.0 when Vref
  = 1.0v)

Rather than build a new project, we re-program the ADC in the user code.  After
looking over the data sheet, the only registers that needs to change are the
ADCA.CH0.CTRL register and the ADCA.CTRLB register:

For unsigned mode / single-ended:

```
	ADCA.CH0.CTRL = ADC_CH_GAIN_1X_gc           /* 1x gain */
	                | ADC_CH_INPUTMODE_SINGLEENDED_gc; /* Single-ended input, no gain */
  ADCA.CTRLB = ADC_CURRLIMIT_NO_gc        /* No limit */
	             | 0 << ADC_CONMODE_bp      /* Unsigned Mode */
	             | 0 << ADC_FREERUN_bp      /* Free Running Mode Enable: disabled */
	             | ADC_RESOLUTION_12BIT_gc; /* 12-bit right-adjusted result */
```

For signed mode / differential:

```
ADCA.CH0.CTRL = ADC_CH_GAIN_1X_gc           /* 1x gain */
                | ADC_CH_INPUTMODE_DIFF_gc; /* Differential input, no gain */
ADCA.CTRLB = ADC_CURRLIMIT_NO_gc        /* No limit */
             | 1 << ADC_CONMODE_bp      /* Signed Mode: enabled */
             | 0 << ADC_FREERUN_bp      /* Free Running Mode Enable: disabled */
             | ADC_RESOLUTION_12BIT_gc; /* 12-bit right-adjusted result */
```
